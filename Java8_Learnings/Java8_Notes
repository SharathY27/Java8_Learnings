Anonymous inner class is mainly used where we need to give implementation on the go.

Lambda expression are one step ahead from anonymous , we can implementation in simple form when compared to anonymous

Lambda Expression Key Notes:

i)   n->return n*n;        ==> invalid
ii)  n->{return n*n;};     ==> valid
iii) n->{return n*n};      ==> invalid
iv)  n->{return n*n}       ==> invalid
v)   n->{n*n;};            ==> invalid
vi)  n->n*n;			   ==> valid

Explanations:

i) Whenever we see return keyword we have to make sure its enclosed within {}.
   Here even though its a single line, since return is used , so it should be enclosed within {}.
  
ii) We have return keyword, so it is inside{} ,its mandatory to have ; after body of statement and {} if return is used
    ; also perfectly used so its valid
    
iii) Invalid because of missing semicolon after body of statement

iv) Invalid because of missing semicolon both body and }

v) here {} are used and no return keyword is used so its invalid

vi) valid because no {} is used and return is only required when {} its used, so its valid


Functional Interfaces:
======================

Normal Interface points:
-----------------------

* Interface methods are by default abstract and public 
* Interface attributes are by default  public ,static and final
* Interface can any number of unimplemented methods
* No Implemented methods allowed


Coming to functional interface

what is functional interface?

	If an interface has only one abstract method (SAM) , then it is called functional interface.
	SAM is single abstract method
	
How to create an functional interface?

	Any interface which has single abstract method ,then its functional interface, we can make use of annotation @FunctionalInterface
	to inform comiler its a functional interface , so in normal interface it will allow you to create any number of unimplemented method
	but when you use @FunctionalInterface annotation and if you create more than one abstract method in interface will throw compile
	time error.
	
	
	Additionally functional interface can have object class methods inside it and also can have default and static methods inside it 
	
	
	We can any number of object class methods, defaults methods in functional interface and default method needs to implemented in functional interface

	
Diamond Problem:
---------------
	default method with multiple inheritance , when an class implements two interfaces which has same methods inside it 
	In this case you need to override any one method in implementing class else use any method present in it
	
	this problem is called diamond problem where compiler dont have idea from which interface it needs to call the unique method
	
	
Static Methods:
==============


 * Since 1.8 in addition with default methods, Java Introduced static methods to be defined in an interface

* Static methods are useful to create utility functions within the interface. Few examples are Stream.of, Comparator.naturalOrder,Comparator.comparing

* Interface's static method is by default not available for implemetation class. so we can't call the static methods present in interface with help of implementation class reference

* Jave Interface static method is part of interface alone so we can't use it with implementation class objects

* The only way to call the interface static method is through the interface name. like <InterfaceName.StaticMethodName>

* Java interface static method is same as default methods except we can't override the static method in implementation classes.


Lambda Expression:
==================

* To invoke/call/use a lambda expression functional interface is required.

* If an interface that you are dealing is an functional interface means we can make use of lambda here

* There are many built in functional interfaces in java 8

Functional Interfaces:
=====================

Function Interface = 1 input and 1 output
Predicate Interface = boolean output
Consumer Interface = 1 input no output
	
	
ForEach function:
================

* In Java 8 we have forEach function which takes Consumer interface as argument (lower bound wildcard)

* Lower bound Wildcard -> If we have a list which accepts Integer values and who else it can hold it ? Parent  ? Yes
						 Parent of Integer class is Number,Object like that classes can hold Integer values
						 <? super  A>
						 
* Upper bound wildcard -> which is nothing but which can hold child datatype of integer class
						 <? extends A>
						 
						 
Example: 
=======
		We have list of Integers , in which we need to print using forEach function, so we will use foreach function like
list.forEach(<consumer interface of lower bound needs to be used>) which means we have Integers type list , now while creating 
Consumer interface , we can create same with list containing Integer datatype or it parent datatype

* Consumer<Integer> consumer = input -> System.out.println(input);  //will work
* Consumer<Number> consumer1 = input -> System.out.println(input);	// will work Number is parent of Integer
* Consumer<Object> consumer2 = input -> System.out.println(input);  // Will work Object is parent of integer


Imagine Like this:
=================

* We learn anonymous inner classes, as a way to give implementation on the go.
* Then we used lambda expressions, better way than anonymous inner classes.
* Now consider method reference as alternative syntax for writing lambdas to make it more readable.
* when you have the implementation avaialble, use method reference.
* when there is no implementation, go with lambdas.
